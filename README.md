# Mini Projects 2025 🚀

A collection of **8 unique and functional projects** I built in 2025 to improve my programming, problem-solving, and deployment skills.  
Each project uses different technologies, requires **no paid APIs**, and is hosted in this repository for learning and portfolio purposes.
